                         <p>  
                              because reading is fun. It’s an easy way for me to leave my room without leaving my room, 
                              you know what I’m saying? If I can visit a thousand worlds from the comfort of my bed but 
                              still have complete creative control of what everything looks like, I am happy. 
                              It’s like wearing other people’s minds in a totally not creepy way. But seriously, what 
                              it comes down to is I really like expanding my perspective. I want to know all the 
                              possibilities. And what financially better way to do that than through a book?

                                   Octavia Butler! She’s a famous sci-fi writer for a reason. I’ve read another one of her 
                                   books called Kindred. While it was a bit depressing, she makes me think about difficult 
                                   things which I somehow seem to enjoy. This book is no different, so far. Basically the 
                                   human race has destroyed themselves and some ‘nice’(?) aliens have offered to help 
                                   rebuild the human race. Only catch is they’ll do it if we genetically modify ourselves. 
                                   It’s a lot of pressure to put on one person, and raises a lot of questions concerning 
                                   morality and ‘what is human?’. Also, cool alien tech!

                                   Now this one hits a bit personally for me. I want to work in animation one day and right 
                                   now it’s kind of known for being male-dominated as a lot of things I’m interested in. 
                                   *sigh* This book takes a look at all the women that contributed to the rise of Disney 
                                   and how they helped make it awesome. (The animation studio, not the corporation, duh.) 
                                   Also, did you know that the first Disney animated film directed by a woman was Frozen? 
                                   We all know how that one turned out…

                                   This is my attempt at creating more structure within my life. I firmly believe that 
                                   anyone is capable of doing anything. I just keep getting in my own dang way. An 
                                   interesting point that’s been brought up in the productivity community over and over 
                                   again is that we should not rely on willpower. It is by far the most energy draining 
                                   and least efficient way to do things. What I need is a good system. And a good system 
                                   is made up of habits. One actionable tip I have learned is to incrementally build a 
                                   habit. Like before you try to work out at the gym regularly, first just commit to going 
                                   there and doing nothing. And then just build up from there.

                                   This is one of those books where I can’t tell you what I like most about it because 
                                   it would give away the entire plot. Don’t worry, no spoilers here. But I will tell you 
                                   this, world-building gets an A+ from me.
                                   <br>
                                   <br>
                                   So, where to start…
                                   <br>
                                   <br>
                                   There’s this village that lives on the edge of a magically corrupted forest. With every passing 
                                   season, the forest grows and inches closer and closer. A wizard has offered to help hold back 
                                   this demon forest. But in exchange, the village must send a girl to live with him in his tower 
                                   every 10 years. Ok, I know how this sounds, but just hold on.
                                   <br>
                                   <br>
                                   This year, a new person must be chosen. Usually he picks the most capable girl. But this time, 
                                   he has to pick the protagonist because. She. Has. Magic. She has to be his apprentice because 
                                   of wizard law or whatever. And he is not happy about it.
                                   <br>

                                   I just enjoy characters that people think are scary but really they’re just tired of everyone’s 
                                   BS because everyone’s an idiot and they just want to go to sleep. And the protagonist seems to 
                                   get on every one of his nerves. Haha, good times.

                                   I found this book very eye-opening. It talks about how the systems humans have built into our world 
                                   are inherently biased towards men. I myself experience the world as a woman, and even I didn't realize 
                                   how much women get ignored. Like this book made me kind of angry about it, then sad.
                                   <br>
                                   <br> 
                                   I'm of the school of thought that we shouldn't be treated differently because of our biological sex 
                                   nor should anyone assume anything about our personality because of it. However, this book brought to 
                                   my attention that even though that is true, women and men still lead different lives in our current 
                                   society. That is just fact. Pure data. But remember, correlation vs causation.
                                   <br>
                                   <br>
                                   One example, mentioned how metro systems in major cities were designed based on regular salaried office 
                                   workers. But people in domestic roles don't travel in the same pattern. They visit places like grocery 
                                   stores, schools, laundromats which end up taking way longer because they have to keep transferring lines. 
                                   And of course, most people in domestic roles right now are women. This is just one example of women 
                                   having to work harder because the world just doesn't think of them when systems are being designed.

                                   This book makes me feel fancy. The words and the atmosphere they create are all so rich and whimsical.
                                   <br>
                                   <br> 
                                   Let me paint a picture.
                                   <br>
                                   <br>
                                   The setting is a circus that only opens at night. The performances are so spectacular that they seem 
                                   like magic. That's because they are. The circus is actually an arena for an age-old bet between two 
                                   master magicians. Every so often, they hold a tournament by training an apprentice and versing them 
                                   against one another. This time, the competition is about who can make the best circus attractions. 
                                   <br>
                                   <br>
                                   But alas, the apprentices fall in love. And the looser must die. So this book has magic AND tension. 
                                   All wrapped up in poetic prose.

                                        The setting is a circus that only opens at night. The performances are so spectacular that they seem 
                                        like magic. That's because they are. The circus is actually an arena for an age-old bet between two 
                                        master magicians. Every so often, they hold a tournament by training an apprentice and versing them 
                                        against one another. This time, the competition is about who can make the best circus attractions.
